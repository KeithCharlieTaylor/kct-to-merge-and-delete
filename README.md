# Keith Taylor on GitHub

Charts the progress of my involvement with GitHub

## Keith Taylor's Current GitHub Activity
I'm considering using GitHub pages as a replacement for WordPress. Soon, I intend to develop web applications using GitHub as a repository for the code. Initially, I intend to run these projects privately. But once I have working models I would like to encourage collaborators.

To start with, I'm paracticing web page creation with this page and the pages I created with the GitHub learning courses. In particular, I want to include:
- Redirects
- Google Analystics Code
- SEO:
  - Meta description and keys
  - Semantic markup
  - Sitemap
- Progressive Web Apps (PWA) manifest, service worker, etc.
- Google AdSense Code
- Google Custom Search Engine Code

## Keith Taylor's Recent GitHub Activity
- Mar 22 2019 - Personal GitHub Pages started and linked to other GitHub Content. I started by creating a repository with the same name as my username. Because that is how I interpreted the instructions at [User, Organization, and Project Pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages). But I didn't spot that I'm required to give the full name, including *'.github.io'*. Anyway, I've decided to restart my GitHub personal website by forking the code at [Get started building your personal website](https://github.com/github/personal-website#get-started-building-your-personal-website)
